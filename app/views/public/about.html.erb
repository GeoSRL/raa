<p class="hero-unit"><b>The Republic: Awareness and Activism</b> is an organization that enables active participation between Americanâ€™s and their governance. We are dedicated to furthering a broad consciousness of political information, and encourage direct communication between individuals and their representatives in government. We seek to create a simple, honest, and effective means to connect people with policies, as well as hopefully avoid the systemic-corruption and stagnation that has overtaken the Party/Media/Lobbyist process.<p>
